Welcome to my page, my name is Lee Mariault and I am a freshly graduated PhD student. My doctoral research, conducted at the Laboratory of Genome and Development of Plants (LGDP) located in Perpignan (France) consisted in studying horizontal transfers events within thousands of plant and fungi genomes. To this end, I developed from scratch a pipeline (Python, R, Bash) in order to perform my analyses. In addition to my expertise in comparative genomics, I also acquired experience in single-cell transcriptomics as well as structural variants analyses during prior work experiences.
