In this review, we synthesize current knowledge on horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in plants, outlining its mechanisms, detection methods, and evolutionary significance. We highlight evidence of widespread plant–microbe and plant–plant HGT, discuss their impact on adaptation and functional diversification, and suggest future approaches to better capture and test these events.
